# Study objectives
- To develop a greater understanding of different biotic and abiotic factors on species traits and trophic levels
- Does latitude affect body size (length and mass) of predators and prey differently? This is based on Bergmann's rule on body size based on temperature.
- Does taxonmic diversity increase at lower latitudes around the equator? This is expected from trends in diversity.
- How does size differ at different depths, with regard to latitude? How does genus change with depth?
- Does sea surface temp change at different rates across latitude and longitude, using bins?
